## Version 10.0.15 Update

### Notable Changes

Now adds an optional extra field to turn off individual zones / players when the Sonos is turned off. Now instead of a ‘pause all’ which stops all players, you can now name, as part of the setup, which players / zones you wish to turn off. NOTE: I can’t at this point confirm if this works fully - please test and feedback! (I need another player or two ;-))
